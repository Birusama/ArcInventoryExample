# Arc Inventory Example Project

This is the example project for Arc Inventory.  

**ARC INVENTORY IS NOT INCLUDED IN THIS PROJECT**

You can get Arc Inventory on the Unreal Engine marketplace: https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/arc-inventory

Included is a number of examples, useful tools, and possible strategies for implementing game features using Arc Inventory.  

All examples and additional helper plugins are licensed under either MIT or Apache 2.0, allowing you to use these in your game.  


## Included Examples

* Basic Setup
* Arc Inventory/Enhanced Input plugin for binding abilities to Enhanced Input
* A useful Game Instance Subsystem for initializing GAS
* An example actor that allows placement of items in the world

## Keeping up to date

We'll be keeping the example project up to date on the latest version of Arc Inventory and Unreal Engine, as they come out.  We'll tag commits on older engine versions, but we won't be back porting newer examples to older engine versions of the example project

## License
All of the examples in this project are open source and permissively licensed, under either MIT or Apache 2.0.  You may chose either license.  

This dual licensing approach provides a few benefits:
* Apache 2.0 provides protection from patent trolling, and reduces license boilerplate
* MIT is compatible with many other open source licenses
* Both licenses have various ecosystems to support them
